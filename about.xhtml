        <p>Hello friend, I am <code>c3866s</code> and I am a Cypherpunk,many people tell to me that I am a Hacker (to
            some
            extend it&#39;s true), but there&#39;s still a long way to go to be one.As a Hacker you are the elite of
            Computer
            Science.</p>
        <p>My interest are mainly about Operating Systems, cryptography, pentensting on networks,so that also results in
            network
            engineering /networking.[you can sum it all up as Cybersecurity Engineering]</p>
        <p>I am a radical user of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>/<a
                href="https://www.linux.org/pages/download/">Linux</a> OS&#39;s, and I have to admit that I distro
            hopped a lot.
            My first distro of all time was <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, but I was too unexperienced
            to use
            it, after that I switched to <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>,then it was <a
                href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> <del>and now I&#39;m dualbooting Arch (again) with <a
                    href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a>.</del>.- Alright I now ended all of my distrohopping
            with <a href="https://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a></p>
        <p>I&#39;m an advocate and supporter for <a
                href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software?lang=en">FOSS</a></p>
        <p>I have a particular interest in alternative/decentralized/<a href="https://www.meshnetworks.com/">mesh</a>
            networks
            like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> or <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">i2p</a>, because the
            Internet
            as we know is no longer secure, sustainable and sufficient <em>and</em> we need a solution for it. </p>
