<p>Hello friend, I am <code>c3866s</code> and I am a Cypherpunk,many people tell to me that I am a Hacker (to some
    extend it's true), but there's still a long way to go to be one.As a Hacker you are the elite of Computer
    Science.</p>
<p>My interest are mainly about Operating Systems, cryptography, pentensting on networks,so that also results in network
    engineering /networking.[you can sum it all up as Cybersecurity Engineering]</p>
<p>I am a radical user of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>/<a href="https://www.linux.org/pages/download/">Linux</a> OS's, and I have to admit that I distro hopped a lot.
    My first distro of all time was <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, but I was too unexperienced to use
    it, after that I switched to <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>,then it was <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> <del>and now I'm dualbooting Arch (again) with <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a>.</del>.- Alright I now ended all of my distrohopping with <a href="https://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a></p>
<p>I'm an advocate and supporter for <a href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software?lang=en">FOSS</a></p>
<p>I have a particular interest in alternative/decentralized/<a href="https://www.meshnetworks.com/">mesh</a> networks
    like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> or <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">i2p</a>, because the Internet
    as we know is no longer secure, sustainable and sufficient <em>and</em> we need a solution for it. </p>
