Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. 
Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know.
 Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.
 We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficenceWe must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. 
We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place. 
Cypherpunks write code. 
We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it.
 We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it.
