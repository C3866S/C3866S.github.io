We all know it we all love it, Linux Distros and their licenses.
This post will contain a simple table with the most favorable and most popular distros on the web, i.e. [Distrowatch](https://www.distrowatch.org) or on [r/Unixporn](https://safereddit.com/r/unixporn)

**So lets start!**

|		Distro		|		Website		|		Opinion |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
|Arch Linux             |      [WWW](https://www.archlinux.org)     |	It's alright, it does the job, the only disadvantage is that it uses soystemd [Why not use SystemD?](https://nosystemd.org/), has some cool deriviants who are full libre [Parabola](https://www.parabola.nu/) or [Hyperbola](https://www.hyperbola.info/)			|
|Gentoo Linux             |      [WWW](https://www.gentoo.org)      |     Perfect, (almost, nothing is perfect, but in a nutshell, it handels my needs very well, having the chance to trim your system to **YOUR** needs is awesome      |
|Debian             |       [WWW](https://www.debian.org/intro/index)      |	Rock solid, can easily choose if you want unstable(SID) with non-free packages (i.e.) or SID with libre packages		|
|Slackware             |      [WWW](http://www.slackware.com/)       |   Rock solid, very old, it is a T-Rex among the distros       |
|MX Linux             |       [WWW](https://mxlinux.org/)      |			suited for newbies, does the job			|
|EndeavourOS             |     [WWW](https://endeavouros.com/)        |		Arch based, does not DDOS the repositories unlike Manjaro, has got some of the sickest wallpapers on the market				|
|Manjaro             |    [WWW](https://ihatetheantichrist.co/)         |			won't give the link 			|
|Mint             |       [WWW](https://linuxmint.com/)      |		did everything right, ditched Ub*ntu and embraced Debian, it does the job perfectly and **muh** just works		|
|Pop!_OS             |    [WWW](https://pop.system76.com/)         |			Tbh. idgaf about their cool laptops, they might be cool, but their OS is trash and just bad, as once mentioned avoid corporate Linux			|
|Kali             |       [WWW](https://kali.org)      |				Who really uses it?		|
|NixOS             |      [WWW](https://nixos.org       |			declarative, reproducable, stable, obviously NixOS is awesome, have been tinkering a little bit with it (a post about it will come in the future)		|
|Alpine             |       [WWW](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)      |			awesome, resource friendly, stable, but pkg is slow (like apt or nix)			|
|Arco Linux             |      [WWW](https://ihatetheantichrist.co)       |			no			|
|Tails             |   [WWW](https://tails.net/)          |		Great for USB, solid and great				|
|Devuan|[WWW](https://www.devuan.org/) | cool, cool idea, generally a C tier |
|QubesOS|[WWW](https://www.qubes-os.org/) |Used it for a year, had my fun with it, it is a great system to learn about virtualization, compartmentalization and digital-minimalism  |
|Deepin| [WWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh) | 天上太阳红呀红彤彤诶|
|Artix| [WWW](https://artixlinux.org/)| ask this guy(who managed to bloat dwm) https://lukesmith.xyz/ |
