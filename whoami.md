Hello friend, I am  `c3866s` and I am a Cypherpunk,many people tell to me that I am a Hacker (to some extend it's true), but there's still a long way to go to be one.As a Hacker you are the elite of Computer Science.

My interest are mainly about Operating Systems, pentensting on networks,so that also results in network engineering /networking.

I am a radical user of [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/) OS's, and I have to admit that I distro hopped a lot. My first distro of all time was [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), but I was too unexperienced to use it, after that I switched to [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/),then it was [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and now I am dualbooting [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/) with [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/).

I'm an advocate and supporter for [FOSS](https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software?lang=en)

I have a particular interest in alternative/decentralized/[mesh](https://www.meshnetworks.com/) networks like [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) or [i2p](https://geti2p.net/en/), because the Internet as we know is no longer secure, sustainable and sufficient *and* we need a solution for it.
